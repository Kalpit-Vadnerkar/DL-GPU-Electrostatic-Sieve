Implementation of the paper: "Deep-Learning Model for Optimization of an Electrostatic Sieve for Lunar Regolith Beneficiation"

# DL-GPU-Electrostatic-Sieve
This study investigates optimizing an electrostatic sieve designed for lunar regolith beneficiation. Two parameters of the electrostatic sieve, 1) the voltage amplitude and 2) the angle of inclination were chosen as variables in the optimization process. Numerical simulations revealed that increasing voltage amplitude significantly enhances sieve performance over the sieve angle. However, optimal separation required careful voltage adjustment for specific sieve angles. A comprehensive dataset incorporating additional parameters was then created to train Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) models for further optimization. The ML models were trained on a small subset of the original dataset to predict the yield. We showcase the potential of DL in lunar resource utilization by optimizing an electrostatic sieve for regolith beneficiation. Our model, trained on lower-yield examples, accurately (92%) identifies parameter combinations that increase yields above 30%. This not only reduces the reliance on resource-intensive numerical simulations but also offers a rapid, validated approach to optimizing equipment for lunar mining operations.
